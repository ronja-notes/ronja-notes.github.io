K Ancrun just... doesnt work that well for me. I do always cry at the end so *something* in them definitely connects with me, but the way there is just kinda ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯. I've read the weight of the stars before I read the wicker king and had a very similar reaction. A friend of mine told me she had read the wicker king first and a big appeal for her was not being sure whether the supernatural things that happened were truly supernatural or something that one person is seeing for one mental reason or another whereas I kinda knew what to expect beforehand.

I think adding to that comes also that the story dwells more on the stuff that happens I'm less interrested in. More on the interresting action stuff and less in the side characters I'm more interrested in (Rina and Gordie mostly ^^, but also Alex(I think was their name??) has so little character building that it feels like they more exist for some resemblance of vibes or realism than for anything else). Its very much a story about big feelings, about love in the face of insanity, about devotion, which put like that I love, but something about it just is a bit removed from what I connect with(within the frame of still connecting enough with me to make me think a lot and cry at the end). Maybe its the writing, maybe its too american, maybe its too much frustrating conflict with people not communicating, I don't know.
